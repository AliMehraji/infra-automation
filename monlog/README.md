## Monlog: Monitoring and Logging Solution
Monlog is a robust monitoring and logging solution designed for Docker Swarm clusters, leveraging the power of Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Alertmanager. This comprehensive suite provides real-time insights and analytics, enabling you to maintain the health and performance of your systems and applications.

### Overview

A comprehensive solution for monitoring and logging various aspects of a system or application. It includes the following components:

- **Prometheus**: The backbone of the monitoring system, Prometheus is an open-source toolkit that collects and stores metrics as time series data. It supports flexible queries and real-time alerting.
- **Grafana**: A powerful visualization tool that allows you to create, explore, and share dashboards that display real-time metrics through graphs and alerts.
- **Loki**: Inspired by Prometheus, Loki is designed for efficient and reliable logging, focusing on horizontal scalability and high availability.
- **MIMIR**: Enhances alerting and notification workflows, integrating seamlessly with Prometheus and Alertmanager.
- **Alertmanager**: Manages and routes alerts generated by Prometheus, supporting deduplication, grouping, and routing to various notification channels.
- **Pushgateway**: Facilitates the collection of metrics from ephemeral or batch jobs that cannot be scraped by Prometheus directly.
- **Discord-alerts**: A custom integration that sends alerts to a Discord channel, ensuring you're notified immediately of any issues.
- **Exporters**: Various exporters (e.g., Node Exporter, cAdvisor) are included to gather metrics from different sources and services, making them available to Prometheus.
